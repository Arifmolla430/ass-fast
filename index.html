            <h1>4 million people affected by the floods</h1>
            <p>About 4 million people have been affected by the worst floods in two decades in northeastern Bangladesh.
                The army is working to take the flood-hit people to a safe haven. Hundreds of shelters have been opened.

                "We are monitoring the situation," said Kamrul Hasan, secretary of the Disaster Management and Relief
                Ministry. The floods have inundated Sylhet and Sunamganj districts. Army members have been deployed to
                rescue the stranded people. We are trying to take everyone to the shelter. "</p>

                You can be by the side of these helpless people if you want.
                It is a great virtue to benefit people.
                Not everyone knows how to do that,
                Let's stand by the helpless people with what we can
